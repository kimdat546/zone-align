## Key Decisions Needed This Week

### 1. Auth Provider Decision
**Options**: Auth0 vs Clerk vs Custom
**Recommendation**: Clerk
**Reasoning**: Better DX, includes Google/Microsoft OAuth, scales well

### 2. Hosting Decision
**Frontend**: Vercel (recommended)
**Backend**: Railway vs Render vs AWS
**Recommendation**: Railway for simplicity

### 3. Database Hosting
**Options**: Railway PostgreSQL vs Supabase vs PlanetScale
**Recommendation**: Railway PostgreSQL (simpler stack)

## Success Metrics to Track from Day 1

### Development Metrics:
- [ ] Feature completion rate
- [ ] Bug rate per feature
- [ ] Test coverage percentage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Early User Metrics (Beta Phase):
- [ ] User registration completion rate
- [ ] Team creation rate
- [ ] Calendar connection rate
- [ ] First meeting scheduled rate
- [ ] Daily/weekly active users

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks:
1. **Calendar API complexity** â†’ Start simple, add advanced features later
2. **Time zone calculation errors** â†’ Use proven libraries (date-fns-tz)
3. **Real-time updates complexity** â†’ WebSocket with fallback to polling

### Business Risks:
1. **Market validation** â†’ Talk to 20+ potential users before building
2. **Feature scope creep** â†’ Strict MVP focus, document future features
3. **User acquisition** â†’ Start building audience during development

## Resource Requirements

### Development Tools Budget (Monthly):
- Hosting: ~$20-50/month
- Auth service: ~$23/month (Clerk Pro)
- Database: ~$10-20/month
- Email service: ~$0-20/month
- Monitoring: ~$0-30/month
- **Total**: ~$50-140/month for MVP

### Time Investment:
- **Full-time**: 12 weeks to MVP
- **Part-time (20hrs/week)**: 24 weeks to MVP
- **Weekend project (10hrs/week)**: 48 weeks to MVP

## Getting Started Tomorrow

1. **Create GitHub repository**
2. **Set up local development environment**
3. **Initialize React + Node.js projects**
4. **Set up basic authentication**
5. **Create first team management features**

The key is starting with the smallest possible version that demonstrates core value: helping a team coordinate meeting times fairly across time zones.
