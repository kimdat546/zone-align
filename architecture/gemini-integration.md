# ZoneAlign - Gemini AI Integration Architecture

## Overview

ZoneAlign leverages Google's Gemini API to provide intelligent scheduling optimization, meeting pattern analysis, and burnout prevention through AI-powered insights.

## AI Integration Points

### 1. Smart Meeting Scheduling (Phase 2)
**Endpoint**: `/api/ai/suggest-meeting-times`
**Purpose**: Generate optimal meeting time recommendations

**Gemini Prompt Structure**:
```
You are a meeting scheduling assistant for remote teams. Given the following data:
- Team member timezones and work hours: [data]
- Recent meeting history and fairness scores: [data]
- Meeting requirements (duration, participants, urgency): [data]
- Current date/time: [timestamp]

Suggest 3 optimal meeting times that:
1. Minimize inconvenience across all participants
2. Respect work-life balance and fairness
3. Consider recent meeting burden distribution
4. Account for productivity patterns by time of day

Response format: JSON array of meeting suggestions with reasoning.
```

### 2. Burnout Prediction & Prevention (Phase 2)
**Endpoint**: `/api/ai/analyze-team-wellness`
**Purpose**: Identify burnout risks and suggest interventions

**Gemini Analysis**:
- Meeting frequency and timing patterns
- Work hour encroachment trends
- Team member accommodation patterns
- Productivity impact assessment

### 3. Meeting Conflict Resolution (Phase 2)
**Endpoint**: `/api/ai/resolve-conflicts`
**Purpose**: Intelligent rescheduling when conflicts arise

**Features**:
- Analyze impact of different rescheduling options
- Suggest alternatives that minimize disruption
- Consider meeting priority and urgency
- Maintain fairness across team members

### 4. Async Workflow Optimization (Phase 3)
**Endpoint**: `/api/ai/optimize-handoffs`
**Purpose**: Identify optimal async work patterns

**Capabilities**:
- Follow-the-sun workflow recommendations

## Implementation Architecture

### AI Service Layer (NestJS)
```typescript
// src/ai/ai.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  providers: [GeminiService, SchedulingAIService, WellnessAIService],
  exports: [SchedulingAIService, WellnessAIService],
})
export class AIModule {}

// src/ai/gemini.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class GeminiService {
  async generateResponse(prompt: string, context?: any): Promise<string>
  async analyzeMeetingPatterns(data: MeetingData[]): Promise<AIInsights>
  async suggestOptimalTimes(requirements: MeetingRequirements): Promise<TimeSlot[]>
}
```

### AI-Enhanced Endpoints

#### 1. Meeting Time Suggestions
```typescript
POST /api/v1/meetings/ai-suggestions
{
  "participants": ["user1", "user2", "user3"],
  "duration": 60,
  "urgency": "high",
  "preferredTimeRange": {
    "start": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
    "end": "2024-01-19T23:59:59Z"
  }
}

Response:
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "startTime": "2024-01-16T15:00:00Z",
      "endTime": "2024-01-16T16:00:00Z",
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Optimal time for all participants...",
      "fairnessImpact": {
        "user1": 0.1,
        "user2": 0.2,
        "user3": 0.0
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Team Wellness Analysis
```typescript
GET /api/v1/teams/{teamId}/wellness-analysis

Response:
{
  "overallScore": 0.75,
  "risks": [
    {
      "userId": "user1",
      "riskLevel": "medium",
      "factors": ["frequent-early-meetings", "high-meeting-load"],
      "recommendations": [
        "Reduce early meetings by 30%",
        "Redistribute meeting load to other team members"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "teamRecommendations": [
    "Consider establishing 'no meeting' blocks",
    "Rotate meeting times weekly for recurring meetings"
  ]
}
```

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

#### Core Principles:
1. **Context-Aware**: Include relevant historical data and patterns
2. **Constraint-Driven**: Specify business rules and fairness requirements
3. **Output-Structured**: Request specific JSON formats for easy parsing
4. **Explainable**: Always ask for reasoning behind recommendations

#### Prompt Templates:
```typescript
// Meeting Scheduling Prompt
export const MEETING_SCHEDULING_PROMPT = `
You are an expert meeting scheduler for remote teams across multiple time zones.

Context:
- Team: {teamName}
- Current date: {currentDate}
- Meeting requirements: {requirements}
- Team members: {participants}
- Recent fairness scores: {fairnessData}

Rules:
1. Meetings should fall within participants' work hours when possible
2. Avoid scheduling back-to-back meetings
3. Maintain fairness - don't burden the same people repeatedly
4. Consider timezone rotation for recurring meetings

Task: Suggest 3 optimal meeting times with detailed reasoning.
Format: JSON array with startTime, endTime, score (0-1), reasoning, and fairness impact.
`;

// Wellness Analysis Prompt
export const WELLNESS_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `
You are a workplace wellness expert analyzing meeting patterns for burnout prevention.

Team Data:
- Meeting history (past 4 weeks): {meetingHistory}
- Work hour boundaries: {workHours}
- Current fairness scores: {fairnessScores}

Identify:
1. Burnout risk factors for each team member
2. Unfair meeting distribution patterns
3. Work-life balance violations
4. Specific recommendations for improvement

Format: JSON with risk levels, factors, and actionable recommendations.
`;
```

## Rate Limiting & Cost Management

### API Usage Strategy:
1. **Batch Processing**: Combine multiple requests when possible
2. **Caching**: Cache AI responses for similar contexts (1 hour TTL)
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Fall back to rule-based logic if AI unavailable
4. **Usage Monitoring**: Track API calls and costs per team

### Cost Estimation:
- **MVP Phase**: ~$50-100/month (assuming 100 teams, 10 AI requests/team/day)
- **Scale Phase**: ~$500-1000/month (1000 teams, 15 AI requests/team/day)
- **Optimization**: Cache common patterns, use smaller models for simple tasks

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
- Basic Gemini integration setup
- Simple meeting time suggestions
- Error handling and fallbacks

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Months 4-6)
- Advanced scheduling optimization
- Burnout prediction system
- Pattern recognition and learning

### Phase 3: Sophistication (Months 7-9)
- Complex conflict resolution
- Predictive scheduling
- Custom team behavior modeling

### Phase 4: Innovation (Months 10-12)
- Multi-language support
- Cultural awareness
- Advanced productivity insights

## Security & Privacy

### Data Handling:
1. **Minimize Data**: Only send necessary context to Gemini
2. **Anonymization**: Remove personal identifiers where possible
3. **Retention**: Don't store AI responses longer than necessary
4. **Compliance**: Follow GDPR requirements for AI processing

### Security Measures:
- API key rotation and secure storage
- Request/response logging for debugging
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Error handling without data exposure

## Testing Strategy

### AI Testing Approach:
1. **Unit Tests**: Mock AI responses for consistent testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Test with real Gemini API in staging
3. **A/B Testing**: Compare AI suggestions vs rule-based recommendations
4. **User Feedback**: Collect satisfaction scores on AI suggestions

### Performance Monitoring:
- AI response times and accuracy
- User acceptance rates of AI suggestions
- Cost per successful recommendation
- Fallback activation rates

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features:
- **Multi-modal AI**: Analyze calendar screenshots, meeting notes
- **Predictive Modeling**: Learn team-specific patterns over time
- **Integration Expansion**: Connect with Slack sentiment, email patterns
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Adjust recommendations based on live feedback

This architecture positions ZoneAlign to leverage AI as a key differentiator while maintaining cost control and user privacy.
