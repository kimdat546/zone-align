## Architecture Patterns

### API Design
**Pattern**: RESTful API with some GraphQL for complex queries
**Structure**:
```
/api/v1/
  /auth/          # Authentication endpoints
  /users/         # User management
  /teams/         # Team operations
  /meetings/      # Meeting CRUD operations
  /calendar/      # Calendar integration
  /notifications/ # Notification preferences
  /analytics/     # Reporting and insights
```

### Database Schema Design
**Key Tables**:
- `users` - User profiles and preferences
- `teams` - Team information and settings
- `team_members` - Many-to-many relationship
- `meetings` - Meeting details and scheduling
- `meeting_participants` - Meeting attendees
- `calendar_integrations` - OAuth tokens and settings
- `fairness_tracking` - Meeting burden metrics

### Real-time Communication
**Solution**: WebSocket with Socket.io
**Use Cases**:
- Live team availability updates
- Real-time meeting notifications
- Collaborative scheduling sessions
- Dashboard updates

### Caching Strategy
**Frontend**: React Query with stale-while-revalidate
**Backend**: Redis for session storage and API response caching
**Database**: Connection pooling with PgBouncer

## Development Workflow

### Code Organization
```
/frontend/
  /src/
    /components/    # Reusable UI components
    /pages/        # Route components
    /hooks/        # Custom React hooks
    /stores/       # Zustand stores
    /services/     # API calls and external services
    /utils/        # Helper functions
    /types/        # TypeScript type definitions

/backend/
  /src/
    /routes/       # Express route handlers
    /services/     # Business logic
    /models/       # Database models (Prisma)
    /middleware/   # Express middleware
    /utils/        # Helper functions
    /types/        # TypeScript types
```

### Development Environment
**Package Manager**: pnpm (faster than npm/yarn)
**Linting**: ESLint + Prettier
**Testing**: Vitest (frontend) + Jest (backend)
**Git Hooks**: Husky for pre-commit linting and testing
**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## Scalability Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- **Frontend**: Code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization
- **Backend**: Database indexing, query optimization, response caching
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery optimization
- **Monitoring**: Core Web Vitals tracking and optimization

### Scaling Strategy
**Phase 1** (0-1K users): Single server deployment
**Phase 2** (1K-10K users): Horizontal scaling with load balancer
**Phase 3** (10K+ users): Microservices extraction for high-load features

### Data Architecture
**Current**: Single PostgreSQL instance with read replicas
**Future**: Potential sharding by team_id for large scale
**Backup**: Daily automated backups with point-in-time recovery

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with short expiration (15 min access, 7 day refresh)
- Role-based access control (team member, admin, owner)
- API rate limiting per user and IP
- CORS configuration for frontend domains

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest (database level)
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Environment variable management
- Secrets rotation strategy
- Input validation and sanitization

### Privacy Compliance
- GDPR compliance features (data export, deletion)
- User consent tracking
- Data minimization principles
- Privacy policy and terms enforcement

## Third-Party API Strategy

### Calendar Integration Architecture
**Google Calendar**:
- OAuth 2.0 with offline access
- Webhook notifications for calendar changes
- Batch API calls for efficiency
- Graceful handling of rate limits

**Microsoft Graph**:
- Similar OAuth pattern
- Unified API for Outlook and Teams
- Change notifications via webhooks

### Error Handling & Resilience
- Exponential backoff for API retries
- Circuit breaker pattern for external services
- Graceful degradation when integrations fail
- User-friendly error messages

## Development Priorities

### MVP Technical Priorities:
1. **User authentication and basic CRUD operations**
2. **Google Calendar integration**
3. **Real-time team dashboard**
4. **Meeting scheduling with time zone handling**
5. **Basic fairness tracking**
6. **Email notifications**
7. **Payment processing**
8. **Deploy to production**

### Post-MVP Technical Debt:
- Comprehensive test coverage (aim for 80%+)
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Advanced error handling and logging
- Security audit and penetration testing
- Documentation and API specifications

This architecture balances rapid development for MVP while setting up foundations for scale and enterprise features.
